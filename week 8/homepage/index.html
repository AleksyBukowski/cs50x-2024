                <h2>About me:</h2>
                <p id="info" class="leftelements">My name's Aleksy and I'm a 20 year old polish student pursuing computer science. My dream job is to work remotely as an programmer, so that I can do travel freely. I love sports, specifically running and cycling - my current life cycling goal is to get to Barcelona all the way from Poland - taking breaks in between, of course. I've been interested in computers since I was a little kid - although my passion faded a little as I am now engaging in more physical activities, the <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50x</a> course made computer science as exciting as it was before for me - which I'm especially thankful for because of David Malan!</p>
